`{smithr}` is a collection of functions I or others have found useful over time.
It is designed to have minimal dependencies, nearly all of them `Suggest`ed
rather than `Import`ed, so you only install what you need.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{smithr}` like so:

``` r
if (!"remotes" %in% installed.packages()) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jesse-smith/smithr")
```
## Caution

The functions here are not intended to be as general as possible; they
mostly focus on my own use cases. I would suggest browsing the source code to
ensure that a function does what you intend before using it in your own code.

## Licensing

Since the package is modular, code may be licensed differently for functionality
with different dependencies. All of my own code is MIT licensed.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that the smithr project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://jesse-smith.github.io/smithr/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html). By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
